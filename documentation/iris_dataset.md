# Iris Dataset Description

The Iris dataset is a classic and widely used dataset in machine learning, introduced by statistician Ronald Fisher in 1936. It contains measurements of three different species of iris flowers. The dataset is often used for classification tasks and is considered a good starting point for learning machine learning concepts.

## Dataset Columns

1. **sepal_length**: Length of the sepal in centimeters
2. **sepal_width**: Width of the sepal in centimeters
3. **petal_length**: Length of the petal in centimeters
4. **petal_width**: Width of the petal in centimeters
5. **species**: Type of iris flower (Target variable)
   - Iris Setosa
   - Iris Versicolor
   - Iris Virginica

## Dataset Characteristics

- Contains 150 instances (50 for each species)
- 4 numeric features
- 1 categorical target variable
- No missing values
- The dataset is balanced (equal number of samples for each class)
- One class (Iris Setosa) is linearly separable from the other two
- The other two classes (Versicolor and Virginica) are not linearly separable from each other

This dataset is particularly useful for:
- Classification tasks
- Data visualization
- Pattern recognition
- Statistical analysis
- Introduction to machine learning concepts
